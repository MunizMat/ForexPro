ForexPro is a foreign exchange web application for performing mock (simulated) trades for the GBP/USD and USD/GBP currency pairs, using real-time data for the exchange rates of each of them. The application provides a dashboard where users can select a currency pair, insert a desired amount for buy or sell, and execute the mock trade. Each user starts with a default account balance of $5000 and Â£5000 and each user has a trade history listing all their past trades.
